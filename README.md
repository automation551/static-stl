-------------------------

**What is SSTL?**

The SSTL is a partial reimplementation of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that strictly avoids the use of dynamic memory allocation.

**Motivation**

Although very handy, dynamic memory allocation is for many developers an unaffordable luxury. In fact, the use of dynamic memory allocation might imply drawbacks such as:
- indeterministic behavior (in terms of latencies)
- synchronization costs in a multithreaded environmnent
- heap fragmentation
- additional memory requirements
- an additional level of indirection (worse locality of reference)

There are applications in which such additional costs cannot be accepted. An example is the embedded world, where systems are often constrained to run with very limited memory resources. Other examples are the fields of finance, gaming, etc. where the introduced indeterminism/latencies might just be too high.

**How was SSTL born?**

I currently make a living from programming CPU-intensive algorithms on an embedded system with quite tight memory constraints. In that system I can't have a heap, since it would at least require some extra memory and I couldn't affort it. As a consequence, many of the much-loved STL components can't be used, since they heavily rely on dynamic memory allocations. To make up for this lack of abstractions I started to reimplement some STL components. For instance, I reimplemented std::vector in such a way that an extra template parameter could be used to specify its fixed capacity. Such new vector could then be used as follows:
```c++
constexpr size_t MAX_ELEMENTS = 10;
auto v = sstl::vector<int, MAX_ELEMENTS>{};
```
The elements are then stored into an internal buffer.

It was fun and relatively quick to reimplement std::vector, however I realized that reimplementing other abstractions such as std::unordered_map would have been more involved. So I looked about for some existing work and I came across the Embedded Template Library (ETL) of John Wellbelove. The ETL provides fixed-capacity reimplementations of many STL containers as well as other generic components. Exactly what I needed one might think! Not quite... unfortunately the ETL has some characteristics that don't really fit my needs:
- Performs runtime checks.
- Part of the library uses virtual functions.
- Doesn't leverage move semantics and perfect forwarding (doesn't leverage modern C++ features in general and will keep doing so in order not to break compatibility with the slow vendors of C++ compilers for embedded systems).
- Memory footprint of components is not always as small as it might be.
- No customizable allocation policies (pools used to allocate nodes of linked lists and BSTs).

In my case the runtime checks, the virtuals and the lack of move semantics and perfect forwarding were especially undesired. In fact having such additional runtime overheads in my algorithms' hotspots would have blown up my latencies and CPU usage. To fix these issues I decided to develop my own static STL library and so the SSTL was born! I started to develop the SSTL from a duplication of the ETL, thus many STL reimplementations of John were straight ready to be used at my company (at least in the non-performance-critical code). Thank you John for making this possible! However, I plan on either reimplement from scratch or drastically refactor many of the components that where originally in the ETL.
